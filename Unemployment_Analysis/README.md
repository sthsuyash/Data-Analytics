# UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON

## Description

This project aims to analyze the unemployment rate in India during the Covid-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labour force.

The detailed analysis of the unemployment rate in India during the Covid-19 pandemic can be found in the [Unemployment_Analysis.ipynb](unemployment_analysis.ipynb) notebook.

## Unemployment

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

## Dataset

The dataset is available in the [unemployment](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india) from Kaggle, which I have downloaded and saved as [Unemployment.csv](Unemployment.csv).
