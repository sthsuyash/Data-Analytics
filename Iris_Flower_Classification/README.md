# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

## Description

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their measurements. The Iris flower dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for practicing classification algorithms.

The detailed analysis of the Iris flower dataset can be found in the [Iris Flower Classification](classification.ipynb) notebook.

## Iris Flower

The [Iris flower](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(plant)>) is a genus of flowering plants with showy flowers. The flower has three species:

- [Iris setosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_setosa)
- [Iris versicolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_versicolor)
- [Iris virginica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_virginica)

which all differ according to their measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset is available in the [iris](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv) from Kaggle, which I have downloaded and saved as [Iris.csv](Iris.csv).

Here, I have a small dataset of all the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and I will train a machine learning model on this dataset to classify the iris flowers.

## Approach

I will use the [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithm to classify the iris flowers.

## Results

The trained model achieved an accuracy of 96.67% on the test set, demonstrating its ability to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.
